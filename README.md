# Virtual Plant Adoption and Care Platform

## 1. Nature and Purpose of the Application
The **Virtual Plant Adoption and Care Platform** is a cloud-native web application that allows users to virtually adopt, care for, and learn about different types of plants. Users can browse plant species, adopt virtual plants into their personal greenhouse, and receive real-time notifications and care reminders. The platform aims to combine education, gamification, and sustainability awareness — encouraging users to learn plant care habits through interactive, cloud-connected experiences.

The backend will be designed for scalability, simulating plant growth and environmental conditions through cloud services and microservices. The frontend will offer an engaging, modern interface that visualizes each user’s adopted plants and their health status.
