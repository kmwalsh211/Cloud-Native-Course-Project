# Virtual Plant Adoption Platform

## 1. Nature and Purpose of the Application
The **Virtual Plant Adoption Platform** is a cloud-native web application that allows users to virtually adopt, care for, and learn about different types of plants. Users can browse plant species, adopt virtual plants into their personal greenhouse, and receive notifications and care reminders. The platform aims to combine education and gameplay, encouraging users to learn about plants through a fun "virtual pet" like game.
